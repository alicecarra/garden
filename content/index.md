title: Welcome to a little corner of my head

Hey everyone! Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I've always wanted to dive into blogging or maybe even start a YouTube channel, but I never really knew where to kick things off. Honestly, just opening up a blank text editor has made me freeze up more times than I can count.

One of the main reasons I decided to start this [[digital-gardening | digital garden]] is to work on my language skills. English isn’t my first language, but I’ve been soaking it all in—reading and listening—for years. However, when it comes to writing and speaking, I tend to shy away from situations that push me to use it. So, when I actually need to write something in English, it can feel pretty tough! My brain just doesn’t seem to form words in English as easily as I’d like. Plus, writing (in any language) has never been my strong suit. I find chatting with people way easier and more natural.

I know, I know—it’s all about practice and getting comfortable with it. That’s why I thought starting to write here, mainly in English, would be a fantastic way to train those skills. I can take my time and use some tools to help me along the way.

So, here you’ll find my thoughts on a bunch of different topics, like music, technology, languages, games, and whatever else I’m currently obsessed with.
