title: Welcome to a little corner of my head

Hey Guys! Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Iâ€™ve always wanted to start a blog, but I never quite knew where to begin. Honestly, Iâ€™ve been a bit scared of opening up that text editor and justâ€¦ freezing. (Yep, thatâ€™s happening right now! ðŸ˜„).

Writing has never been my strongest suit. I find chatting with people way easier and more natural. In a conversation, I get instant feedback from the other person, which helps me know when to elaborate or speed things up.

One of the big reasons I decided to start this [[garden]] is language. English isn't my first language, but I've been soaking up everything in Englishâ€”reading and listeningâ€”for years now. However, when it comes to writing and speaking, I tend to shy away from situations that push me to use it. So, when I actually need to write something in English, it can feel really tough! My brain just doesnâ€™t seem to form words in English as easily as I'd like.

I know, I know â€” it's all about practice and getting comfortable with it. That's why I thought starting to write here, primarily in English, taking my time and with a little help of modern tools, would be a great way to exercise those skills.
