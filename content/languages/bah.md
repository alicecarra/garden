title: Bah

I recently started a Chinese course at [Instituto Confúcio](https://www.ufrgs.br/confucio/sobre-o-instituto/), and it hit me that we actually have a tonal language right here in southern Brazil! I mean, at lest for the term **bah**.

**Bah** is a expression used in many scenarios, mostly for sharing feeling expressions. I will try to express the vibe that some of the variants give using the pīnyīn (拼音) tones.

- Bāh: Incredulous
- Báh: Indignation
- Bǎh: Suprise
- Bàh: Sorrow

As a kid and teenager, I really wasn't a fan of this expression. I only used it as a joke when I wanted to imitate a "true gaúcho." But somehow, I started using it unconsciously from time to time. Whenever I caught myself saying **bah**, I couldn't help but start mocking at myself! Some years laters and now I'm a true embracer of **bah**.
