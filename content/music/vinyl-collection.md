title: My Vinyl Collection
---

Ever since I got into music, I’ve been really into “old music.” Most of the songs I listen to are from the '60s, '70s, and '80s. I think that’s what draws me to the whole vinyl record vibe - just has this authentic feel and sound that people experienced back them.

My first vinyl record was "The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table" by Rick Wakeman—what a mouthful, right? I picked it up at a seller's exhibition while visiting the Public Market in Porto Alegre. One of the things that really caught my eye about this record was the inserts. At the time, I didn’t even have a record player, but my friend said, “My dad has one! you can come over and listen to your new record!” So, we were super excited, but to our surprise, when we got to her dad's house, the player was broken. So the record became only a piece of decoration in my house.

Fast forward a couple of years to 2022, when I finally took the courage (and dipped into my savings) to buy my first player — a simple, used Aiwa PX-E850. By 2024, I could count on one hand the records I had, and I’d only listened to them a couple of times. But in just one year, my collection has exploded! I’ve got so many records now that I don’t even have (a decent) space to store them all.

So, as we wrap up the year, my boyfriend and I took on the task of cataloging all our records. I'm going to do my best to keep that list updated. My plan is to share some thoughts on these albums with the time.
