title: Digital Gardening
---

I was checking out some highlights from This Week on Rust and came across a blog post about [memory alignment and layout](https://garden.christophertee.dev/blogs/Memory-Alignment-and-Layout/Part-1). It had a super clear and really nice explanation of the topic. After that, I jumped over to the homepage and started scrolling through the site, doing a little "dynamic reading." I really liked the layout and how everything was organized. At the bottom of the page, I noticed that Chris used a site generator called [Quaartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). So, I checked it out and stumbled upon the term `digital gardening`. I ended up diving into the [philosophy](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/philosophy) and [networked thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) sections, and it was pretty fascinating.

I finally figured out why I’ve had such a hard time starting to write all these years! I’ve always wanted to share my thoughts, discoveries, and knowledge on different topics, or just keep some information handy. But every time I thought about where to store it, what tools to use for creating and managing it, and if I ever wanted to publish, I got overwhelmed. I tried Notion, Obsidian, and even Blogger, but I never really got anywhere and ended up giving up.

On top of my nerves about starting to write, I constantly worry about getting things wrong or leaving out important details—or worse, writing something that makes no sense at all. But reading those sections really helped me shake off those feelings. Now, I’m super excited to dive into all the things I’ve always wanted to do and start planting those seeds and saplings!
